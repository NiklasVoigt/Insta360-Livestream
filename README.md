# Insta360-Livestream
Since insta360 doesn't offer the possibility to get the livestream with a computer without a cell phone in between I reverse engineered the apk, found the port 6666, then analyzed a tcpdump of my cell phone and the camera and rebuilt the tcp communication to get the livestream of the camera.
